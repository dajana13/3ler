# 3Ler - first React project

I used this project to learn React. I found it interesting because it was a small page, but it had many problems to solve.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Version History
